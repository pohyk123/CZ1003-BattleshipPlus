## Project Description
The objective of this project is to design a program that allows the user to play an extended version of Battleship with a virtual enemy (CPU).
There are 2 main components to the game: account management system & gameplay.
The user account system allows users to register and play the game.
During gameplay, there are 3 phases - field preparation, battle & endgame phase.
Each player owns 2 territories - above- & sub-sea. Ships can only be placed above-sea, but submarines can be placed on either.
Each player then takes turns firing onto each other's maps; the game will end when either all the player's or the enemy's ships are sunk.

## Instructions
1. Ensure [config] & [pygame] packages are installed.
2. Run main.py
3. Enjoy the game! :)

## Future Developments
- Password reset
- Highscore tracking
- P2P mode

## Tips
- Turn on your audio!
